# System to study the application of the knex database

A whole study was done to apply the database to a local database, that is, it work locally on the machine where the project is.

## In which cases  can this technology be used

I used this strategy for when I'm testing or creating the small application, where, there will not be as many users, this is not because the technology does not accept it, but because I did not see it as a good solution for that, all my study applications use this technology.

## what is needed to use this technology

it's only necessary to create a configuration file to inform where the database, migrations, and seeds will be created.
